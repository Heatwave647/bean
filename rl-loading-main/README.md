# Red Line Loading Screen (`rd-loading`)

A sleek, animated, and configurable loading screen for FiveM, built for the "Red Line: Cayo Perico Anomaly" server concept. This resource provides an atmospheric and informative entry point for players, designed to be easily modified and integrated into any server.

It is fully standalone and does not require any specific framework.

## Configuration & Customization

Customizing the loading screen is designed to be straightforward. Most changes are made in the `html/index.html` and `html/style.css` files.

### üéµ Changing the Music

1.  Get your desired music track and make sure it is in `.mp3` format.
2.  Name the file `music.mp3`.
3.  Place your `music.mp3` file inside the `html/assets/` folder, replacing the placeholder file. The script will automatically pick it up.

### üìù Editing Text and Links

All text content (rules, guides, etc.) and connection links are located in the **`html/index.html`** file. Open it with any text editor to make changes.

**Example: Changing a rule**
Find this section:
```html
<section id="rules" class="content-section">
    <h2>Field Regulations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><i class="fas fa-ban"></i> <strong>Zero Tolerance:</strong> Cheating, exploiting, or hacking.</li>
        </ul>
</section>
```
Simply edit the text within the `<li>` tags to match your server's rules.

**Example: Changing the Discord link**
Find this section:
```html
<section id="connect" class="content-section">
    <h2>Establish Comms</h2>
    <div class="connect-links">
       <a href="#" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-discord"></i> Join our Discord</a>
       </div>
</section>
```
Replace the `#` in `href="#"` with your actual Discord invite link.

### üé® Changing Theme Colors

You can easily change the main theme color (the red highlights) by editing the CSS variables at the top of the **`html/style.css`** file.

```css
/* Define CSS Variables (Custom Properties) for easy theme changes */
:root {
    --primary-red: #ff3333; /* CHANGE THIS VALUE */
    --dark-red: #d10000;   /* CHANGE THIS VALUE */
    /* ... other colors ... */
    --border-color: rgba(255, 51, 51, 0.5); /* This one is also based on red */
}
```
Change the hex codes for `--primary-red` and `--dark-red` to any color you like to instantly re-theme the entire loading screen.
